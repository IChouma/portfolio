            <p>Hello! My name is Abdeljabar and I enjoy creating
                things that live on the internet. My interest in web
                development started back in 2018 when I decided to
                try editing custom Bloger Templates 
                taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
                Fast-forward to today. My main focus these days is building accessible,
                inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients,
                And learning Mobile developpment.
                <br /><br />
                I also recently build a E-commerce complete website using HTML, CSS JAVASCRIPT, REACT.JS(Class,Hooks), REDUX/REDUX-TOOLKIT.
                <br /><br />
                Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
            <div>
                <img src="" alt="" />

        <div className='skills'>
             <Sk/>
        </div>
    </section>
    </Fragment>
